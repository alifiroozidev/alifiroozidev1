Hereâ€™s some of my favorite subjects that I tried make them only by Web technologies like JavaScript! That was a nice challenge that could improve my web development skills. Check out the Repos

before programming I was a 3D artist years ago and now I can create 3D AR and VR commercial apps and 3D web experiences with the help of OpenGL and javascript. 
For some time, I was the technical lead of a startup tech company and because of my job in the field of smart city, I'm a little familiar with the technologies of maps and location services development, photogrammetry software, IoT and edge computing , self-driving cars ML, etc. which are all somehow related to the smart city, and sometimes I publish my codes as well.
